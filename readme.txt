this is the client for the to do list app, which has drag and drop feature

Here the user can add the task via the form in home.jsx page.

The user can drag and drop, from one category of task to another.

I am also using the react-dnd for the same.

When a user drags among the same class. Shifting of array happens in the same class.

And when a user drags to different class, first in the front end itself that is removed. And later target class elment is created,
and shifting is performed so that it can go the desired place.
